
This directory provides an example for using PowerShell scripts from 
IGLibScripts to clone or update several repositories from different sources 
via PowerShell scripts.

InitIGLibScripts.ps1 first clones the IGLibScripts repository and loads
PowerShell utilities from the cloned repository. It then uses utility
scriptts from the repository to clone other repositories.
