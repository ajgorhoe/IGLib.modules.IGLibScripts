# Directory Viewer Project

The **[diercyory viewer C# project](./IG.Scripts.DirectoryViewer.csproj)** has been created to be included in Visual Studio's solution and in other .NET IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) such that **contents of the** repository **directory can be browsed** in the respective IDEs, such as in *Visual Studio's Solution Explorer*.

In order to **not interfere** with usual workflows and other tools and to **be unobtrusive**, the project file is **put to its own directory**, which is placed in another subdirectory of the repository (and not in the repository root).
